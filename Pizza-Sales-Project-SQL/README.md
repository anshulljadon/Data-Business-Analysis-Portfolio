  * Ability to clean and structure raw data
  * Analytical thinking for business decision-making
  * Writing clear, optimized SQL queries
  * This is an end-to-end SQL analysis project, starting from raw CSV files to insight-driven queries.

##Business Objective

  * PizzaHut wants to understand:

##Dataset Description

  ####The project uses 4 datasets in CSV format:

  File Name	                      Description

  orders.csv	                    Contains order date and time information
  order_details.csv	              Line-level details of each order
  pizzas.csv	                    Pizza size and price details
  pizza_types.csv	Pizza names     categories, and ingredients

        
        
##Tools & Technologies Used
  
  * SQL (MySQL)
  * CSV datasets
  * Relational database concepts
  * Joins, aggregations, subqueries

##Data Cleaning & Preparation (SQL)

  * The following cleaning steps were performed using SQL:
  * Removed unnecessary columns
  * Ensured correct data types (dates, integers, decimals)
  * Handled duplicate and missing records
  * Created meaningful joins between tables

  * Total number of orders placed
  * Total revenue generated
  * Top-selling pizzas
  * Revenue contribution by pizza category
  * Order trends by date and time
  * Average order value
  * Most popular pizza sizes

# Running the Analysis

   * Start the Jupyter Notebook server
   * Open the notebook in your web browser
   * Execute cells sequentially using:
         -Shift + Enter, or
   * The Run button in the toolbar
   * *ll outputs and visualizations will be displayed inline

# Analysis Workflow

   * The notebook follows a structured analytical approach:
   * Data Loading: Importing and initial exploration of the dataset
   * Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and data preprocessing
   * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics and      distribution analysis
   * Data Visualization: Graphical analysis using plots and charts
   * Statistical Analysis: Correlation analysis and hypothesis testing
